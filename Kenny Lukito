From the advertisement you put on a CNN newspaper regarding the new job vacancy available in your company. I am here to apply for the job as a web developer in the marketing section.

<p>
I had experiences working as a web developer in some of my previous jobs before, I am finding a better web developing role such as the job you offered. I studied at <b>Melbourne University</b> and <i>1 year</i> of studying in the <b>most reputiational web developing course</b>, which is why I believe it suits what the job needs. In addition, I am a <b> hardworking and disciplined person</b>, which is more than enough for the desires of your company.
